If the password is entered correct a menu will appear which would be for the users of the parking system.

There are 4 functionalities for the user:
1) Arrival of a vehicle: The system will ask which type of vehicle you have to park. A car or a bike. Then the system will ask the numerical part of the plate number of the vehicle. the system will check whether the entered plate number is correct or not. 0 cannot be entered in the plate number and a plate number already present in the parking cannot be entered again. If the entered plate number meets the conditions, then the system will ask about number of hours the vehicle will be parked. Then a bill will be generated and the vehicle could be parked inside the parking.
